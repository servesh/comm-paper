% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Motivation}

The constant advancement in server hardware has made systems with large number of hardware threads[] readily available. In addition to this the presence of co-processors[], network processors[], Graphics Processing Units ( GPUs ) \& General Purpose GPUs ( GPGPUs ) has dramatically improved the capability of commodity hardware. These developments has paved way to a platform with immense computing potential which existing applications already take advantage of. Along with the improvements in the Multi-Core \& Many-Core processor architecture the memory and I/O speeds have also seen significant improvement. In particular the network subsystem has seen significant growth, in combination with the improvements to optical communication it has lead to 10GbE interfaces being quite common in enterprise servers. While 40GbE and 100GbE are available for backbone infrastructure but would eventually follow into commodity hardware. 

Network applications represent those applications that operate on any of the seven network layers described in the OSI Model. \{describe more here\}

Several previous work have discussed the process of parallelizing network applications[][][] to enable it to run faster in such multi threaded systems. The development of Software routers[][][] is encouraged further because it costs only a fraction of the commodity hardware routers. Moreover the advancements in the network interfaces has made faster interfaces readily in combination with the multi core servers the performance  It has been shown that such routers can be used to process packets at line rate [][][] which has been a challenge on its own. Network applications including those that operate on few or all of the network layers have been designed with sequential processing as the target environment. The shift to multi core architectures in recent times has induced such applications to utilize parallel processing as a alternate means of computing. While this could lead to significant improvement in performance it also suffers from the same problems as any parallel application. These include scalability, load-balancing, data dependency and the presence of non parallel regions in the program apart from those that might arise due to that specific application. The scaling of software routers has been discussed extensively in RouteBricks[] which shows the problems suffered by software routers when they are scaled beyond a single system. One could argue that complexity of network applications such as Deep Packet Inspection ( DPI ), Packet Forwarding, etc., could be handled by a single many socket Multi-Core SMP system. However, as the complexity of network applications develops it would be inevitable but to move to a multi node environment in order to perform the computations and to handle more network bandwidth.

Large scale computing clusters has been used in high-performance scientific application to solve problems and applications of very large size. It uses a cluster of compute nodes and distributes the workload across them in order to solve it faster. These systems utilize parallel programs consisting of both threads and MPI to break massive problems into smaller workload that can be executed in parallel. In addition, the presence of GPUs and GPGPUs requires a mixture of parallelization constructs such as OpenCL, CUDA, etc., in order to achieve the best performance in the system. In this paper we discuss how some of the techniques used by these applications could be used to parallelize network applications.

Click Modular Software Router[] consists of extensive elements which are used to construct software routers. Click primarily targets packet processing applications especially those that operate on L4 - L7. \{elaborate more here\}

Discuss about what each sections contains here.....  

\section{Background}

Talk about click...\\

Describe about what would be the best way to parallelize using threads and MPI.. provide reference.. \\ 

\section{Design}

This section describes the design principles related to our methodology. The objective is to determine the requirements necessary to parallelize network applications. Our methods focus on ways to improve the click system in some cases even extend its functionality.

\subsection{Emphasize on user level execution environment}

The existing software routers are predominantly implemented in the kernel space for the ease of access to resources and can bypass the OS overhead incurred when data is accessed through the network subsystem. While this alternative provides better performance it also leads to concerns regarding stability and security of the system. Newer techniques such as Netmap[] allows direct access to network buffers which makes it possible to write high performance packet processing applications in userspace itself. Typically network applications which operate on L4 - L7 are developed in the kernel space in order to intercept the network packets before it flows through the OS. Whereas those applications that utilize L1 - L3 are present in the user space. The objective here is to completely switch to user space to solve any of the stability or security concerns. In addition, scenarios where the applications that operate across most or all the layers could be improved by combining the operations across the different layers in user space itself.  

\subsection{Eliminate the overhead associated with creation of dynamic objects}

Click constructs application graphs based on dynamic creation of objects and passing the data packets across the virtual functions. Though this is a very elegant approach in creating the software router it does incur the penalty of the virtual function tables. The click-tool[] addresses this issue but it does not solve the problem entirely. The construction of the software router at run time is the primary reason behind it. This mainly arises due to the presence of kernel module which installs the router as a kernel module based on the input configuration. However in the user level it would not be necessary for a separate process to initialize the router instead we could generate the entire program statically including the necessary flow associated with the specific application. This not only eliminates the overhead associated but also opens up means to optimize the graph further. 

\subsection{Optimize based on application graph}

Network applications especially that operate on the lower layers are very sensitive to the overhead associated with operating on the data separately on each layer. Instead given an application graph if we were to provide a sequential flow of the different functions at the various layers then it would be possible for the compiler to optimize the regions of program into a single and optimized block of code. This would also improve the cache locality of the data accessed by consecutive functions. This also presents us with the ability to perform other types of stream graph optimizations[] which would not be possible if the specific graph was constructed dynamically at run time.

\subsection{Automated data parallelism}

Network traffic is a classic example by which data parallelism can be utilized to achieve scalable parallelism. Click's support for parallelism in user level is described as experimental, it is implemented by using a task graph consisting of each work associated with each element which is executed in the threads. The support for parallelism in the kernel mode is better in comparison to that of user mode. Since our target environment is in the user space the proposed design involves a different approach to which we can extract data parallelism. We first split the data across multiple queues and then replicate the application graph across to process the data the queues in parallel. An important condition here is to make sure packets of the same flow should pass through the same queue. Since the application graph can be replicated it also makes it possible to dynamically load balance several applications based on the workload.   

\subsection{Efficient implementation of task parallelism}

In generating the application graph as a sequence of operations it also makes it possible to process different stages of the operation in a pipelined manner. This when combined with stream optimizations and could be used to determine which steps of the graph is best suited to form the stages of a pipeline. The condition to balance here is the weight associated with computation in that stage with that of the overhead incurred in computing the data in two separate stages. It would be necessary to determine whether the additional over head involved in executing the task in parallel provides any significant improvement in performance. 

\section{Implementation}

Click was designed as a means to easily implement a software router on top of a Linux OS. This is implemented in two different ways one is by installing a kernel module and the other is a program that executes in the user level. Both of them accept a configuration file described in click's language specification. This is then used to construct the router by linking the virtual functions for the push and pull operations of the different elements in accordance with the specified graph.

\subsection{Modifications to click system}

\subsubsection{Static Generation Of ???}
The first step in the design was to overcome the limitation of using click's infrastructure to construct the software router which consists of dynamically initialized objects and virtual functions. This was necessary due to two important conditions, one was to eliminate the overhead associated with the dynamic construction of the objects and virtual functions and the other was to provide the compiler a chance to optimize the program during the compilation phase. This would however result in not being able to construct the software router using click's infrastructure but would require the application specific code to be recompiled. This could be a significant hurdle in the case of running the software router in kernel mode where the router configuration is installed by the click kernel module in which case the entire kernel module should be recompiled and reinitialized. Whereas in user space this would not be an issue since routers of different configurations are basically treated as separate applications and would just have to go through an additional compilation phase before being used. The added advantage of this would be to enable network applications that operate on L1 - L3 layers to use the packet processing ( L4 - L7 ) infrastructure provided by click elements.

\subsubsection{Implementation of data parallelism}


--Talk about MPI \& threads\\

--Our goal here is to focus on the network application as a workload and characterize it as such without involving any kind of overhead that might occur due to the network.\\

\section{Conclusions}



% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared

%\caption{Simulation Results}

%\end{figure}

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
